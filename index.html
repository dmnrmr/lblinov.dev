              When I joined we were an agile team of ~12 people. Challenge of the time was
              to move product delivery to Riga by downsizing outsource team and increase
              number of people and grow capability in Riga. The product was a spa b2b
              application that allowed customer to create and follow the lifecycle of
              invoice with debt collection features and later a factoring options. It was
              developed with
              <span class="lb-tech lb-tech--angular">Angular</span> framework and later
              injected with <span class="lb-tech lb-tech--ngrx">ngrx</span> stack.
